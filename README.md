## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Davisone â€” a recent graduate (BSc Administration - Accounting Option) of the University of Ghana with a passion for building scalable, context-aware solutions at the intersection of technology, policy, and education. I thrive on turning complex challenges into actionable systems, whether itâ€™s deploying containerized microservices, designing adaptive EdTech platforms, or crafting culturally resonant brand identities.

My work blends technical precision with strategic thinking. Iâ€™ve led projects in Python, Docker, MongoDB, and Redis, and Iâ€™m currently focused on modular architectures for EdTech and healthcare. I also explore AI-assisted learning, inclusive mobility solutions, and creative design systems for mission-driven initiatives.

ðŸ”§ **Skills**: Python, Go, Docker, Redis, MongoDB, scalable app architecture, policy synthesis, branding  
ðŸ“š **Interests**: EdTech innovation, EV mobility, AI tools for low-bandwidth environments, scenario-based learning  
ðŸš€ **Current Projects**: PHRONESIS â€” a modular EdTech platform for Ghanaian tertiary education  
ðŸŽ¯ **Long-Term Vision**: Transform Ghanaâ€™s system through tech-driven, policy-relevant learning

Im happy to collaborate with anyone on any best project of any kind
